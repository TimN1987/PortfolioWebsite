A simple portfolio website, displaying projects I have been working on, created in Blazor.

## 🎯 Aims:

- Gain familiarity with using Blazor:
  - Use @code blocks to integrate C# with Blazor components.
  - Explore Blazor components, e.g. EditForm and NavLink.
- Further practice with HTML and CSS:
  - Work on creating responsive designs.
  - Develop confidence with animations using CSS.
- Create a simple website to display my learning.

## 🪜 Next steps:

- Add a "fun" section to make more use of C# for interactive features.
- Add further Project pages to include more detail and filtering by framework or language.
