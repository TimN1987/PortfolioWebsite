				Hello, my name is Tim! I’m an experienced teacher transitioning into software development. I’ve always enjoyed logical thinking and 
				problem solving, and programming has become a natural extension of those interests. I love tackling new challenges, learning new technologies, 
				and building clean, maintainable solutions that feel intuitive for the user.
			</p>
			<p>
				My core experience is with C# and .NET, where I’ve built WPF and WinForms applications using MVVM and Dependency Injection to keep my projects 
				well-structured and extensible. I’ve also explored enhancing desktop applications with Python integrations — including using PyTorch to build 
				a reinforcement-learning Battleships player for one of my WPF projects.
			</p>
			<p>
				More recently I’ve been developing web applications with Blazor, alongside strengthening my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. I enjoy combining 
				backend logic with thoughtful UI design, and I’m continually expanding my knowledge as I move toward a role in professional software development.
			</p>
